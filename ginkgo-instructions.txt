# Steps:
1. Navigate to project path above.
2. Create a directory "data" under the path. In here, dump A.mtx [This is COO matrix created at Python Code], b.mtx [This has to be a dense vector, COO vector doesn't have a transpose in Ginkgo], x0.mtx is just a dummy vector passed to Ginkgo as a starting guess. x0.mtx has the same size as b vector. Also created in Python
3. The main code is present under the above path as simple-solver.cpp. It has the full implementation.
#How to Run
1. Navigate to the "build" directory under the above path
2. Run "cmake .." - cmake file has already been configured. Once complete, go to Step - 3
3. Run "make" - This will create the executable simple-solver inside build.
4. To see the solution, run ./simple-solver - You are still inside the "build" directory.
